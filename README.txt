 iMMOD: An Interactive Model of Mosquito Distribution
===============

Date Created: March 30, 2018

This Google Earth Engine (GEE) code visualizes NASA Earth observations, citizen science and public health data relevant to mosquito habitat suitability. The code also implements a model to predict habitat suitability for mosquitoes in Western Europe.

 Code Dependencies
===================
Access to GEE through a Google Gmail account

Go to https://earthengine.google.com/ and click “SIGN UP” at the top right of the screen and enroll using your Google Gmail account

If unfamiliar with JavaScript and/or GEE, it is strongly encouraged that you complete the Introduction to Google Earth Engine Tutorial (condensed), which can be accessed here: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials


 Parameters
===================
Below are a list of steps needed to access and run the code.

Accessing the code:
1. Using a Gmail account, sign up for GEE
2. Once signed up, open up the script titled “iMMOD” through the NASA DEVELOP repository

Running the code:
1. When the script is displayed in the code editor, simply click “Run” at the top of the window and the introductory window will pop up on the interface.
2. You can interact with the map by turning on and off different layers, querying data by month, and zooming to specific areas of interest. Follow the tutorial provided to learn about these different capabilities.
3. The code also provides instructions on how to create your own monthly habitat suitability map, starting at line 1592.
